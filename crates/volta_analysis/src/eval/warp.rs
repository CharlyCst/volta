//! Warp-cooperative operations: `bar.warp.sync`, `shfl.sync`, `ldmatrix`,
//! `mma.sync`, and the `wmma` family.
//!
//! Each of these is modeled as the paper's `sync I` for the participating
//! lane group, followed by the operation's cooperative data movement /
//! compute. The group fires only once every participating lane has arrived
//! at the same pc with the same mask (see `Interpreter::find_ready_warp_group`).

//! Memory reads/writes performed by these ops are attributed to the exact
